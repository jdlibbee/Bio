    <p>
        My name is Justin Libbee and I grew up Reno, NV where I studied baking and pastry, and worked in the culinary industry.
        I moved to Lake Powell and worked at Boat Rentals during the Summer. After the Summer season ended I moved to Park City,
        and loved it so much that I decided to stay in Utah. After 5 Winters in Park City, I moved to the Salt Lake valley. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After moving to the valley I started working in customer service at 1800-Contacts where I was a supervisor, and a part time trainer. 
        I spent 2 years at 1800 Contacts, and was not able to grow more with the company, so I found a start up called Jet.com 
        where I started in customer service on the phones. I shortly moved over to the Tactical Operations and Product Catalog team. 
        On my team we work with developers back East to help correct any issues with the order flow, communicate with members and merchants
        in regard to orders, as well as correct listing issues on the site. I'm in the bootcamp to help learn web development, and see where it can take me.
